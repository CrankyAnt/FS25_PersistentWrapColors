# Persistent Wrap Colors

Ever wondered why all your wrapped bales in Object Storage turn into the same plain white stack?  
This mod makes sure every bale keeps its **original wrap color** – exactly as you made it.

## Features
Just like in the field:
- Black bales stay black  
- Pink bales stay pink  
- Yellow, Blue, Red, Green… all remain visible  

No more confusion about which silage is which.  
Each bale retains its unique wrap color while stored, and shows correctly when taken back out again.

## Compatibility
- Works globally with all **basegame Object Storages**  
- Supports **modded storages** that use the same specialization  
- Pure **script implementation** – lightweight, plug & play, no extra models required  
- **PC only** (script mod)

## Installation
1. Download the mod from **ModHub** or **GitHub**
2. Place the `.zip` file in your mods folder
3. Activate in-game via the mod selection menu
